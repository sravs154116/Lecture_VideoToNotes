# Lecture_VideoToNotes
This project automates lecture note-taking by converting video/audio lectures into text using a local Whisper AI model. It generates interactive multiple-choice quizzes from the transcript and provides a downloadable transcript for easy study. The system is fully offline, user-friendly, and scalable for multiple lectures.
